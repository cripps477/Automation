tree command to show the file structure
The inventory file lists the 

[group name]
ip address

[group:children]
the group and the other groups nested groups

At the top of the directory there will be a site.yml file, this will include the roles, keep the structure
the all.yml if included will be tried by default
the site.yml will reference the roles, in the case of these the role is the router role.
within the role there will be tasks, the task to be performed named main.yml
within the role there will be templates, this will house the router.j2 (jinja template) where the template will be created
within the role folder there will be vars this will include varible these are defined as below:


---
 - router
   host: r1
   loopback: 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
   gig0ip: 192.168.110.250 255.255.255.0


The jinja file will have something like:

{{item.gig0ip}}

item being a iterator, the gig0ip being the gig0ip
This isn't deployed to any router rather instead the template is created the location is sepcified within the tasks file.
